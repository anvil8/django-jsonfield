django-jsonfield
----------------

django-jsonfield is a reusable Django field that allows you to store validated JSON in your model.

It silently takes care of serialization. To use, simply add the field to one of your models.

Python 3 & Django 1.7 supported!

Fork from https://github.com/bradjasper/django-jsonfield.git, changed for multi-table inheritance support.
